== Tips

=== Debugging

You should definitly make effective use the debugging tools from the IDE
(breakpoints, keybindings, call stack, watches, expressions).
Otherwise you are just waisting your time.  Most IDE either use
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger[GDB] or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLDB_(debugger)[LLDB], and they share most of the
basic concepts.  You can https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq8l1_-QgAc[learn the basics] 
fast and start **practicing**.

(Many times, the compilation or runtime error message is not helpful at all or
borderline cryptic.  Debugging tools help a lot.)

Prof.Â Guanira states it clearly in "Guia de Creacion Ejecucion y
Depuracion.pdf":

=== Formatting

Using
https://cplusplus.com/reference/library/manipulators/[
stream manipulators] and
https://cplusplus.com/reference/ios/ios_base/fmtflags/[
stream format flags] can be cumbersome, but the course _requires_ them since
using `printf` is not allowed. So maybe macros can be helpful here.

See link:tips/formatting.adoc[] for an example implementation and usage.
