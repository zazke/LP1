== Tips

=== Incremental development

Many times, compilation or runtime error messages are not helpful or
borderline cryptic.  Debugging tools help a lot.  But narrowing down what
component most likely failed is of **great** help.  Develop each "module"
separately, compile and debug frequently.  Make sure each "module" works fine
before moving to the next one.

=== Debugging

You should definitly make effective use the debugging tools from the IDE
(breakpoints, keybindings, call stack, watches, expressions).
Otherwise you are just waisting your time.  Most IDE either use
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger[GDB] or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLDB_(debugger)[LLDB], and they share most of the
basic concepts.  You can https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq8l1_-QgAc[learn the basics] 
fast and start **practicing**.

Prof.Â Guanira states it clearly in "Guia de Creacion Ejecucion y
Depuracion.pdf":

=== Formatting

Using
https://cplusplus.com/reference/library/manipulators/[
stream manipulators] and
https://cplusplus.com/reference/ios/ios_base/fmtflags/[
stream format flags] can be cumbersome, but the course _requires_ them since
using `printf` is not allowed. So maybe macros can be helpful here.

See link:tips/formatting.adoc[] for an example implementation and usage.
