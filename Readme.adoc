== Tips

=== Debugging

Prof.Â Guanira states it clearly in "Guia de Creacion Ejecucion y
Depuracion.pdf":

=== Formatting

Using
https://cplusplus.com/reference/library/manipulators/[
stream manipulators] and
https://cplusplus.com/reference/ios/ios_base/fmtflags/[
stream format flags] can be cumbersome, but the course _requires_ them since
using `printf` is not allowed. So maybe macros can be helpful here.

See link:tips/formatting.adoc[] for an example implementation and usage.
