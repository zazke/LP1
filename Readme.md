## Tips

* Debugging:  
  
  Prof. Guanira states it clearly:

  ![Debugging is essential](img/ss_20220916_200135.png)

* Formatting:
 
  In my opinion, using [stream
  manipulators](https://cplusplus.com/reference/library/manipulators/) and
  [stream format flags](https://cplusplus.com/reference/ios/ios_base/fmtflags/)
  is cumbersome,  but the course *requires* it's use (usually using `printf` is
  not allowed).  So maybe this macro eases it's use.
